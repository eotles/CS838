Ok. This is a file abou the data matrix.

The data matrix is 2D construct that start with index [0,0]

to access the mRNA expression array of sample i,

use data_matrix[i]

to access mRNA expression j of sample i,

us data_matrix[i,j]

In skitlearn packages, the feature vectors is the same order as our data_matrix, that is 

X[i] will give a feature vector in input data X.
